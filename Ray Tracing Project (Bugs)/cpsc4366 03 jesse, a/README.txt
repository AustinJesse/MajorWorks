This folder is organized into assignment 1&2 and assignment 3. Assignment 1&2 are assignments from the past that have working code. However the assignment 3 code does not compile. 
This is due to some broken classes. To fix this the light class would need to be updated with more light functions. The int main in SourceMain.cpp has one unit test.
This unit test should output a shape material that has a roughness from an eye and camera view if light class was fixed. 
This would be shown with an external file that goes to an external program for showing the image.
